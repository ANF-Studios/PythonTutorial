#Hi there, if you ever need help. You can join my Discord Server: https://discord.gg/fKWpK7A

# Let's start by comments since I wil be talking a lot. So you start a comment by "#" and it remains a comment
# for the rest of the line.
# <= This is used to make a comment

# Now let's start by simply Hello World. Now, if you may have noticed there aren't any classes or import/using
# statements. Nope, Python is perfect for beginners. Here is an example of Hello World!
print('Hello World!')

# Now, notice how you have used different quotation marks. It is not wrong, however other
# coding languages don't support this
print("Hello World")

# Now take a look at this, cool isn't it, you can also do it like: print('Hello' + World)
print('Hello'
	  + ' World!')

#And now, for the final part, notice how you can still use a semicolon
print('Hello World!');

# Okay, all this Hello World is getting pretty boring.. So let's do something fun!
# Maths xD
number = 10 # We are declaring a variable that gets detected by Python. This is an integer and you
           # do  not need to use the specific name "number", you can use anything you want, as long
		   # as it is not repeating..

print(number) # Here we are going to write that number

# Now, that we know what a variable is (something that stores data) and how to write it.. let's
# combine them

variable1 = 10
variable2 = 5

print(variable1 / variable2) # Oh by the way the slash is an operator. Other operators are + - *

# Other operators:
print(variable1 + variable2)
print(variable1 - variable2)
print(variable1 * variable2)

# Speaking of operators, there is something fun in python that is not found in other languages..
# Spoiler Alert: It uses math with alphabet letters
# Here is an example:
print(3 * "word") # Note that other operators (+ - /) will not work and throw an
                  # exception, not to be confused with error.
				  # Oh and, this will output: wordwordword, if you want a space
				  # between them you can simply use: print(3 * "word ")

# Here's another fun thing that you can do with numbers:
a, b = 3, 4 # a = 3, b = 4
print(a,b)
print(a + b) # Here are some more things that you can do.
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)

# Also remember that this will NOT work!
one = 1
two = 2
hello = "hello"
print(one + two + hello) # You cannot use any kind of digit with a string

# Now, id you want a number in a print without adding them, you can do:
print('{0}, {1}'.format(a, b))

#It will also work if you do:
print('{}, {}'.format(a, b))

# And one last thing, if you want to declare a variable null, you use this:
ExampleVariable = None # None is how you say it is nothing

# Hopw it was easy :D
